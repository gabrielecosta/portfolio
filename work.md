# Work experiences

### Ph.D. student in Computer Science
**Description:** Ph.D. position at the University of Palermo in the field of Artificial Intelligence applied in the CyberSecurity domain.
- **Location:** Università degli Studi di Palermo, Department of Engineering (Palermo, Italy)
- **Duration:** November 2025 - present


### Postgraduate scholarship
**Description:** Research Fellow activity entitled “ADELE: ADaptive Ensemble LEarning for Network Security” carried out at the
 University of Palermo. The research activity focused on the study and implementation of advanced adaptive and
 explainable machine learning techniques, in the context of network security in particular in Intrusion Detection
 Systems (IDS), in order to realize adaptive autonomous systems. These activities lead to the implementation of a novel architecture that ensure both prevention capabilities and accountability via eXplainble AI, as well as adaptive mechanisms for incoming novel threats. 
- **Location:** Università degli Studi di Palermo, Department of Engineering (Palermo, Italy)
- **Duration:** May 2025 - November 2025

### Postgraduate scholarship
**Description:** Research Fellowship activity entitled "Study and definition of artificial intelligence techniques to cope with cyber attacks" carried out at the University of Palermo. This research activity focused on studying and implementation of
machine and deep learning techniques, in the context of network security, particularly in Intrusion Detection Systems
(IDS). The main activities involved studying of the phenomenon of concept drift in network traffic and its effects in
systems evaluation. These activities lead to the implementation of a data generator to generate concept drift from a
dataset, and the proposal of a new method of systems evaluation, both in offline and online phases.
- **Location:** Università degli Studi di Palermo, Department of Engineering (Palermo, Italy)
- **Duration:** October 2024 - May 2025

### ICT Consultant
**Description:** Internship activities carried out the company ABC Solutions as an IT consultant, aimed at the implementation of software solutions for business management, based on Odoo technology (a Python framework). The main activities I was involved in: meeting with customers, project management and requirements analysis, implementation of custom software for customer and consulting at customers for the proposal of new solutions.
- **Location:** ABC Solutions (Palermo, Italy)
- **Duration:** June 2023 - February 2024

### Software Developer
**Description:** During this internship, I contributed to the development of a WebApp using the Angular JavaScript framework. The project involved both frontend and backend activities, including the design and implementation of the user interface, the creation of a database to collect and manage dynamic data from the application, and the development of APIs to enable communication between the interface and the database. The internship also included an in-depth study of unstructured databases, focusing on data management and manipulation technologies, as well as key aspects of cybersecurity.
- **Location:** Coding A Vision (remote)
- **Duration:** June 2020 - February 2021

### Software Developer
**Description:** Internship activity aimed at the creation of a web platform for the management of a smart parking, in the perspective of the project "Training for the future". The main activities were: study and development of a web platform, both frontend and backend, and development of API to be able to reserve a parking space within the webapp. The platform was designed with Javascript and Jquery frameworks.
- **Location:** Bosch (Milan, Italy)
- **Duration:** July 2019 - July 2019

### Software Developer
**Description:** Erasmus+ Traineeship activity carried out at the University of Salamanca. The activity focused on the development of an e-learning platform for the faculty of Microbiology, using the Moodle framework. 
- **Location:** Universidad de Salamanca (Salamanca, Spain)
- **Duration:** June 2019 - July 2019
